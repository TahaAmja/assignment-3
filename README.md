# explanation:
Approach:
first focused on each function with struct fromed before hand.
learning:How structs and fucntion can be used together so naturally in a c program. 
# Q2:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d76b076-1669-4bfb-a2ad-71e2af3700ed)
# Explanation:
Approach:focused on game requirements first then moved on to players and their data and score using struct.
learning:basically you could display a complete match using a optimized enough C program.
# Q3: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e559505-1e01-4e36-87a5-a4eb4ea49e61)
# Explanation:
Approach:fulfill email requirements using functiion then use it in main.
learning: Even better understandin of string.h.
# Q4:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58db0c21-dbcf-4b9d-b83a-f35af0154d4f)
# Explanation:
Approach:Made a program for a single employee first then moved on to the other requirements.
learning:Differrent ways of dynamic memory allocation
# Q5:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/639393a7-7eb5-42ee-9dc2-465217e8e969)
# Explanation:
Approach:use varying pointers as required for inventory and use DMa to clear program at the end.
Learning:Use of pointers and memory allocation three dimensionally.
# Q6:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e50b33cb-dc2c-4922-9511-e2985d7b59e3)
# Explanation:
Approach: Nested struct layout tben input in structs then finally the function and int main.
Learning:Ufurthur understanding of working of nested structs in Lengthy C programs .
# Q7:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb54fcf-6fce-4749-bb3d-0c7c7b7e8785)
# Explanation:
Approach:just do allocation majinly through functions and assign them in main C program along with using structs .
Learning:Furthur understanding of working of memory allocation in C .
